        Hi, my name is Kevin and I'm a rising senior at Drexel University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Film Productions. I've always liked mathematics and computers. To me, Computer Science is a practical application of computing and math.

      <p>
        During High School, Film Productions also caught my interest as I learnt about all the intricacies involved in making a good video. I founded Northeast Studios to form a community of people with the same interest as me to learn more about the process of filmmaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also a personal tutor for students across the country. The time spent teaching my students math, science, and programming is all worth it when they let out a huge epiphany after they understand the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my free time, I like to have simple road trips to explore nature through hiking, fishing, camping, and essentially any outdoor activities. I have a personal dream of sailing around the world and visiting countries that I've never heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm always seeking to fulfill life and looking for my next adventure.
